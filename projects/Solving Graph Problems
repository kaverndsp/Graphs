1. Describe the problem using graphs terminology
    what are your node?
    when are nodes connected?
    what are your connected components?

2. Build your graph, or write your getNeighbors() function
    figure out how to get the node's edges

3. Choose your algorithm , and apply it


Example
Given two words (begin_word and end_word), and a dictionary's word list,
return the shortest transformation sequence from begin_wprd to end_word, such that:

Only one letter can be changed at a time.

Each transformed word must exist in the word list. Note that begin_word is not a transformed word.

begin_word = 'hit'
end_word = 'cog'

return ['hit, 'hot', 'cot', 'cog']

begin_word = 'sail'
end_word = 'boat'

['sail', 'bail', 'boil', 'boll', 'bolt', 'boat']
